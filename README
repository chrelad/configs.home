Configuration files for my home computer. I'm
hosting this on Gitweb for a couple of reasons.
First of all, if things go south with this
computer, I want to have some stuff backed up.
Secondly, things are working pretty well with
this computer, and if other people want to see
how I got things working properly, they can
check out the configuration files hosted on
gitweb. Everyone wins!

This is the type of computer I have:
  Linux desktop 2.6.28-gentoo-r1 #1 SMP PREEMPT Fri Jan 30 05:16:19 CST 2009 x86_64 AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 4400+ AuthenticAMD GNU/Linux
